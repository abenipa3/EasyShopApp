# Easy Shop

## Summary
Customers are turning to various applications to have their groceries delivered to their doorsteps. Easy Shop was built to provide real-time updates of grocery items in stocks from local stores and alerts the users when the item is not available. This also enables customers to easily choose their preferred alternative item and avoid receiving the wrong item upon delivery. Easy Shop also contains a feature that allows users to save their grocery list for future use that can be modified at any time before checkout. 

We built Easy Shop to enable smooth communication between the customers and the Easy Shop team, including a messaging app, notifications on items available and out of stock, and more.
